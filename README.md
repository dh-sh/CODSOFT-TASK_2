So basically, the goal is to build a model that can predict the rating of a movie based on things like its genre, director, and actors. The idea is to look at past movie data and find patterns that can help us estimate how well a new movie might be rated.

First, we need to gather and clean the data. The dataset has different details about movies, like their names, release years, durations, genres, ratings, number of votes, directors, and main actors. Some of these, like year, duration, and votes, are numbers, while others, like genre and director, are text. The main thing we want to predict is the rating, which is a numerical value that shows how much people liked the movie.

Before training a model, we have to prepare the data properly. Missing values need to be dealt with because incomplete data can mess up the model. Some columns, like duration and votes, might have extra symbols or commas, which need to be cleaned up to make them numerical. Categorical features like genre and director can’t be used as they are, so we have to convert them into numbers using techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding.

Once the data is ready, we split it into training and testing sets. The training data is used to teach the model the relationship between features and ratings, while the testing data helps check how well the model performs on new data. Usually, we use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

Since we are predicting a numerical value (the rating), we use a regression model. A good choice for this is the random forest algorithm, which creates multiple decision trees and takes an average of their predictions to improve accuracy. This model works well because it can understand complex patterns between movie features and ratings.


Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, we check how well it performs. Since this is a regression problem, we use metrics like mean absolute error and root mean squared error to measure how close the predictions are to the actual ratings. Lower values for these metrics mean the model is doing a better job.

Finally, we analyze the results to see which features have the most impact on ratings. Feature importance analysis helps us understand whether certain directors, genres, or actors influence ratings more than others. This can be useful for movie makers, producers, and streaming platforms to predict how successful a movie might be before it’s even released.
